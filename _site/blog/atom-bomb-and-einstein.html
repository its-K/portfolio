<p>This is the most popular equation of all time in the world</p>

<h2 id="genius">Genius</h2>

<p>Albert Einstein is perhaps most famous for introducing the world to the equation E=mc2. At the same, he discovered that energy and mass are interchangeable. And do believe that he paved the way for nuclear power—and atomic weapons ?</p>

<p>At one level, the equation is really simple. It says that the energy (E) in a system (an atom, a person, the solar system) is equal to its total mass (m) multiplied by the square of the speed of light (c, equal to 186,000 miles per second). Does that sounds simple ! This all started when he was working on a Refrigerator.</p>

<h2 id="how-refrigerator-led-to-atomic-bomb">How Refrigerator led to Atomic Bomb</h2>

<p><img src="https://www.viva.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/facebook_og_image/public/Albert%20Einstein_0.jpg?itok=kF8obH83" alt=""></p>

<p>In the 1920s, while living in Berlin, the physicist collaborated with Hungarian graduate assistant Leo Szilárd to develop and patent an energy-efficient fridge. While their design never went to market, the duo’s work ultimately just stopped . But even after failure the two scientists stayed in touch.</p>

<h2 id="chain-reaction">Chain Reaction</h2>

<p>You all might heard about Hitler the Chancellor of Germany who led the World War 2. Yes this started in his period. In 1933, the same year Adolf Hitler became chancellor of Germany, Szilárd (Partner of Einstein) discovered the nuclear chain reaction—the process that unleashes the energy locked in atoms to create enormous explosions.</p>

<p>Yeah the same process used in Refrigerator to create explosions. However Hitler get to know the process chain reaction can be used in bombs, by 1939 he ordered the German scientists to develop an atomic weapon.</p>

<p>After knowing this, Szilárd approached his one-time colleague—then the world’s most famous scientist (Einstein)—and asked him to warn U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt about Germany. Szilárd visited Einstein in New York with two fellow refugees, Hungarian physicists Edward Teller and Eugene Wigner.</p>

<p>When they told him about the possibility of a nuclear chain reaction being developed by Germany, Einstein was shocked at the danger posed by his 1905 special theory of relativity.  <b> “He certainly was not thinking about this theory as a weapon” </b></p>

<h2 id="a-letter-that-made-atomic-bomb">A Letter that made Atomic Bomb</h2>

<p><img src="https://veterans.nv.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/hiroshima-bombing-article-about-atomic-bomb.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>After hearing all this the renowed scientist wrote a letter to Roosevelt that Nazi scientists beat the United States with an atom bomb.After getting the letter Roosevelt formed a team of US scientists to work on a top secret government project, Manhattan Project.</p>

<p>Though the commitee was formed to create a atom bomb, they was only given $6,000 in funding. Einstein continued to write letter to Roosevelt for more funding by warning that Szilárd would publish key nuclear findings in a scientific journal if they was not better funded. Thus by this way he made the Manhattan project Sucessful.</p>

<p>After all this the <b>First Atom bomb</b> was created at Berlin, Germany, in 1938.</p>

<p>On August 6, 1945, the United States dropped its <b>First</b> atomic bomb over the city of Hiroshima, Japan. The “Little Boy” exploded with about 13 kilotons of force, leveling five square miles of the city and killing 80,000 people instantly.</p>

<h2 id="father-of-atomic-bomb">Father of Atomic bomb</h2>

<p>“He is the father” of the atom bomb, says Beser, who is the grandson of the only U.S. serviceman aboard both planes that carried the atomic bombs to Japan.</p>

<p>Still, Einstein name is forever connected to the greatest discovery of most powerful weapon.</p>
